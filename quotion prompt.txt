📑 SECTION 1: PROJECT SUMMARY

Project Type: Rooftop Solar
Capacity: 3.4 KW
Project Location: cuddalore

📊 SECTION 2: PRICING DETAILS
Particulars	Details
Capacity	3.4 KW
Total Cost	₹2,20,000
Subsidy Amount	₹78,000
Net Investment	₹1,42,000
ROI	27%
Payback Period	3.5 Years
Lifetime Power Savings (25 Years)	₹9,92,800
⚙️ SECTION 3: PROJECT DETAILS & CALCULATIONS

Units generated per year:
3.4 × 4 × 365 = 4,964 Units / Year

Cost saved per year:
8 × 4,964 = ₹39,712 / Year

Lifetime savings (25 years):
25 × 39,712 = ₹9,92,800

Payback period calculation:
(Total Cost – Subsidy) / Yearly Savings
1,42,000 / 39,712 ≈ 3.5 Years

🌱 SECTION 4: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

CO₂ emission saved:
4,672 × 0.7 × 25 = 81,760 Kgs (≈ 81 Tonnes)

One tonne of CO₂ equals 46 trees per year

This home offsets pollution equal to 3,726 trees in its lifetime
